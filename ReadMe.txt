Unzip data.rar before running

1: Run main.ipynb file.
2: This is a binary classification problem, solved using Convolutional Neural Network.
3: Based on VGG 19 Model for classification of dustbins.
4: Dustbin are classified into two categories Overflowed and Not Overflowed.
5: data.rar file contain train, testing and validation images
6: train folder containers data for training the VGG 19 model.
7: Testing contains data for testing the model.
8: At last validation data is used for evaluation.
